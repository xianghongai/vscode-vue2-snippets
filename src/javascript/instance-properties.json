The `default` property contains either nodes not included in a named slot or contents of `v-slot:default`.\n Please note that slots are not reactive. If you need a component to re-render based on changes to data passed to a slot, we suggest considering a different strategy that relies on a reactive instance option, such as `props` or `data`.\n Note: `v-slot:foo` is supported in v2.6+. For older versions, you can use the deprecated syntax.\n Accessing `vm.$slots` is most useful when writing a component with a `render(createElement)` function.\n"

Scoped slot functions are now guaranteed to return an array of VNodes, unless the return value is invalid, in which case the function will return `undefined`.\n 2. All `$slots` are now also exposed on `$scopedSlots` as functions. If you work with render functions, it is now recommended to always access slots via `$scopedSlots`, whether they currently use a scope or not. This will not only make future refactors to add a scope simpler, but also ease your eventual migration to Vue 3, where all slots will be functions.\n2.x Syntax: `this.$scopedSlots.header`\n3.x Syntax: `this.$slots.header()`\n"
