These mixin objects can contain instance options like normal instance objects, and they will be merged against the eventual options using the same option merging logic in `Vue.extend()`. e.g. If your mixin contains a created hook and the component itself also has one, both functions will be called.\nMixin hooks are called in the order they are provided, and called before the componentâ€™s own hooks."
